## Body Text:

```markdown
Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on **MacroStudio** - a native macOS app that lets you record and execute keyboard macros with global hotkeys. Think of it as automation for repetitive tasks without the complexity of scripting.

## What it does:

- ⚡ **Record** keyboard shortcuts, mouse clicks, and typing sequences
- 🎯 **Edit** your macros with a visual timeline editor
- ⌨️ **Execute** them instantly with custom hotkeys from anywhere
- 📅 **Schedule** macros to run automatically at specific times
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** - everything stays on your Mac, no cloud sync

## Why I built it:

I just don't want to pay for expensive automation tools.

## Tech Stack:

- 100% Swift & SwiftUI
- Native macOS Accessibility APIs
- MVVM architecture
- UserDefaults + JSON for storage
- Universal binary (Apple Silicon + Intel)

## Download & Links:

- **Website**: https://vijaysimhaa.github.io/MacroStudio/
- **Download (Free)**: https://github.com/Vijaysimhaa/MacroStudio/releases/latest/download/MacroStudio.dmg
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Vijaysimhaa/MacroStudio

## Requirements:

- macOS 13 Ventura or later
- Accessibility & Input Monitoring permissions

## Coming Soon:

Planning to open source it once I clean up the code a bit more. Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

**Note**: The app requires Accessibility permissions (macOS standard for automation tools) to capture and simulate keyboard/mouse events.

## Sample Comments to Expect (Prepare Answers):

**Q: "Why not use Keyboard Maestro?"**
A: Great tool! MacroStudio is free, open source (soon), and focused on simplicity. It's for users who want basic macro automation without the learning curve or price tag.

**Q: "Security concerns with Accessibility permissions?"**
A: Totally valid concern! The app is sandboxed and only uses Accessibility APIs for recording/playback. Code will be open source soon so you can audit it yourself. All data stays local on your Mac.

**Q: "Windows version?"**
A: Native macOS only - built specifically for Apple's ecosystem using Swift/SwiftUI. Keeps it lightweight and well-integrated.

**Q: "How is this different from Automator?"**
A: Automator is great for workflows, but doesn't do real-time keyboard/mouse recording. MacroStudio captures your actual actions as you perform them, making it easier for repetitive UI tasks.
